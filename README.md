## Chunk Copy
Chunk Copy is a Fabric Minecraft mod used for downloading multiplayer worlds by copying their chunks and pasting them into singleplayer worlds. This mod adds a client-side command `/chunkcopy` that is used to copy and paste world chunks. All copied world chunks are stored in the `mods/chunkcopy` directory.  
  
- **Warning:** This mod does not feature a way to undo and redo changes made to chunks. Please be careful as any wrong moves made cannot be undone.
